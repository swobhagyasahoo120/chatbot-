# chatbot-
gives you the time required to study and news of countries

 Problem Statement
Many students struggle with time management, underestimating the hours required for effective study. Additionally, they face difficulties in staying informed about current events relevant to their studies. This project addresses these issues by providing a chatbot capable of predicting study hours and fetching curated news.
Motivation
With increasing academic pressures, there is a need for tools that can assist students in managing their time efficiently. The dual functionality of this chatbotâ€”predicting study hours and aggregating newsâ€”is designed to enhance the learning experience. Its relevance is bolstered by the growing adoption of digital learning tools.
Objectives
1.	Develop a chatbot to predict study hours based on user input and historical data.
2.	Integrate a news aggregation system tailored to studentsâ€™ interests.
3.	Ensure user-friendly interfaces and seamless functionality.
Scope of the Project
The project focuses on creating a freemium chatbot that combines educational and informational services. While the current scope is limited to study hour predictions and news aggregation, future iterations can include additional functionalities like exam preparation tips and internationalization
